# Passenger Counter

This is actually my first 'frontend' app I have ever made and deployed. It was fun to learn javascript and create this project.

Here's the link of my deployed project: https://aesthetic-bombolone-42b4b8.netlify.app/

This was the first part of 'Learn JavaScript' course by Scrimba and it covered these topics:
- script tag
- variables
- numbers
- strings
- functions
- the DOM concept
- getElementById() function
- innerText and textContent
- how to deploy using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can access the link of the course [here](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v)!
